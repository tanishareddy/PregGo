Why PregGo?
Every day, over 700 women die from preventable pregnancy-related causes, and nearly one maternal death occurs every two minutes. Despite global progress, maternal 
mortality remains unacceptably high in low-resource regions, including India, where delayed access to healthcare, lack of real-time monitoring, and insufficient prenatal
education put countless lives at risk. Implementing digital health solutions with real-time monitoring, AI-driven alerts, and remote consultations is not just innovative—it 
is critical to ensuring timely interventions, improving maternal outcomes, and saving thousands of lives every year.
